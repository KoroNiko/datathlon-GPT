# Notes about the dataset, competition, ideas

We want to tell a story; what is the pitch if we create the map with the evolution of different movements over the years?
Ideas:

- Where do AI-generated images fall into that category?
  - We need to be able to separate the man-made with the AI-made images (feasible)
  - If the AI-generated images have a designated style, then we can already answer the question with a simple query (not interesting)
- The general question of how do AI-generated artworks fit in the movements, etc.
- Another idea is to make the pitch interactive and ask the interviewers questions
- How did artists influence one another?
- Use the data (artworks) as input to a model to generate music
- Visual art analysis (colors, shapes, textures)

Features to implement

- Color extraction
- Assign a date to each artwork (based on the artist birthdate + ~25 years)
- Face detection (Artist portraits)
- Edge detection
- Combine some of the above with the timeline
- Add some important events in the timeline


Done
- Place to each artwork
- Movement to each artwork
